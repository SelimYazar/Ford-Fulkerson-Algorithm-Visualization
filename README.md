Ford-fulkerson-Algorithm with html, css and javascript The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a widely used algorithm to solve the maximum flow problem in a flow network. The maximum flow problem involves determining the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source vertex to a sink vertex in a directed weighted graph, subject to capacity constraints on the edges. The algorithm works by iteratively finding an augmenting path, which is a path from the source to the sink in the residual graph, i.e., the graph obtained by subtracting the current flow from the capacity of each edge. The algorithm then increases the flow along this path by the maximum possible amount, which is the minimum capacity of the edges along the path.
